## Date

**April 17th, 2026**

## Venue

**UAntwerp Stadscampus**  
Building C, Aula C.001  
Prinsstraat 13  
Antwerp, Belgium

## Getting There

To reach the center of Antwerp efficiently, we recommend to come by public transport or bike as much as possible, as the car traffic is notorious in and around the city.
The venue is located in room C.001, in Building C of the UAntwerp City Campus, which is best reachable via the entrance at Grote Kauwenberg 1, 2000 Antwerp (See [Google Maps](https://maps.app.goo.gl/2sUwQUGmfw3k6e5A8)). From there, follow the arrows to building C

### By train

- Take the train to Antwerpen-Centraal
- Go by foot (15 minutes) to the venue or take bus 17

### By bike

- There are bike stalls around Grote Kauwenberg 27. UA personnel can usually make use of the secured bike stalls, but might be closed during Easter holiday period

### By car, consult these useful resources

- Check the current works & events ongoing in Antwerp at ([Slim naar Antwerpen](https://www.slimnaarantwerpen.be/en/works-events))
- Ideally, drive to a Park & Ride and take the public transport from there. These are either free or 1€ per day, see [Park & Ride](https://www.slimnaarantwerpen.be/en/car-taxi/park-and-ride)
- If you do want to drive in the city center, there are public parkings you can make use of, see [Public Car Parks](https://www.slimnaarantwerpen.be/en/car-taxi/public-car-parks)
